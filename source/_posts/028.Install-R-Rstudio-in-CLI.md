# Install R & Rstudio in CLI on Mac
## Install homebrew
Homebrew is awesome, since you can just install things wtih your terminal, like yum, apt-get in Ubuntu.

First, turn on your terminal. If you didn't install homebrew yet, just copy & paste the following script.

``` bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

or you already installed homebrew, just update it.

``` bash
brew update && brew upgrade
```

## Install R & Rstudio
You gotta extend the respositories by installing Cask. Just don't be cared, follow the steps of each line.

``` bash
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install brew-cask

brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
brew cask install java

brew tap homebrew/science
brew install R

brew install Caskroom/cask/rstudio
```

Then, you can get this.

 * note
  - While you got into several steps, it would bootstrap. It could take more than an hour sometimes. Don't be panic, and take a cup of coffee reading some posts in Facebook or some.
