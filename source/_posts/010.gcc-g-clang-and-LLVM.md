# How does g++ work with c++11 codes?
Let's say that we run a simple program which consists of  following C++ codes.
``` C++
// test_noc++11.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1,2,3};
    vector<int> vi(arr, arr + sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]));
    for (vector<int>::iterator it=vi.begin(); it != vi.end(); it++){
        cout << *it << endl;
    }   
    return 0;
}
```
when you build this cpp file, it works well with g++.

``` bash
$ g++ test_noc++11.cpp
$ ./a.out
1
2
3
```
My question starts from here. What about c++11 codes? Does it work with my complier without any problem? So let me go for it.

``` C++
// test_c++11.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1,2,3};
    vector<int> vi(arr, arr + sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]));
    for (const int& data : vi){
        cout << data << endl;
    }   
    return 0;
}
```
This code is using the "Range-based for loop" enhancement in C++11. When I tried to compile this, we can see the warning like following.

``` bash
$ g++ test.cpp
test.cpp:9:23: warning: range-based for loop is a C++11 extension [-Wc++11-extensions]
        for (const int& data : vi){
                             ^
1 warning generated.
$ ./a.out
1
2
3
```
It works anyway, what about the version of gcc then?

``` bash
$ g++ --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.38)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin
```
| version | Release Date |
| --- | --- |
|GCC 4.2.2|October 7, 2007|
|GCC 4.2.1|July 18, 2007|
|GCC 4.2.0|May 13, 2007|

the version of gcc is indeed 4.2.1, which doesn't support C++11 since it's developed in 2007.

# What are clang and LLVM?
So what makes my code work? What are clang and LLVM? Let's go a little deeper.


> Clang /ˈklæŋ/[4] is a compiler front end for the programming languages C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, OpenMP,[5] OpenCL, and CUDA. It uses LLVM as its back end and has been part of the LLVM release cycle since LLVM 2.6.

> The LLVM compiler infrastructure project (formerly Low Level Virtual Machine) is a "collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies" used to develop compiler front ends and back ends.
> LLVM is written in C++ and is designed for compile-time, link-time, run-time, and "idle-time" optimization of programs written in arbitrary programming languages. Originally implemented for C and C++, the language-agnostic design of LLVM has since spawned a wide variety of front ends: languages with compilers that use LLVM include ActionScript, Ada, C#, Common Lisp, Crystal, D, Delphi, Fortran, OpenGL Shading Language, Halide, Haskell, Java bytecode, Julia, Lua, Objective-C, Pony, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, CUDA, Scala, and Swift.

All right. I just figured out when I run the g++, llvm-gcc is indeed running, which is the gcc frontend, and then the llvm backend. On the other side, clang++ is running clang, which is the clang frontend and then the llvm backend. Following

So, my g++ is actually using clang-LLVM 8.0, which supports c++11, even c++14.

DONE.

## Further questions
- what are front-end compiler and back-end complier? I should've taken the complier coursework during my B.S :(
- who made the clang & LLVM? are they open-source projects?
