# Tips on tech interviews by Gayle Mac

## 1. how companies evaluate tech interviews
 - you gotta focus on communications
1. Talk a lot loud to express thought process
2. At least, try to summarize what you try to do
3. little mumbles are better than staying silent

## 2. how to approach behavioral questions
 - short intro
1. quick shows of success
2. key strories (let the interview ask for details)
3. hobbies (tech / non-tech)

 - prepare to dicuss at least 2-3 projects in detail
1. techinial role
2. soft skills
3. about the bad stuff
 - mistakes
 - failures

## 3. 7 steps to solve algorithm problems
1. listen
2. example
3. brute force
4. optimize
5. walk through your algorithm
6. code on a writeboard or on a paper
 - coding style matters
   - consistnet braces
   - descriptive variables
   - modulize
7. test
 - analyse
 - use test cases

## 4. 3 algorithm strategies
1. BUD
 - Bottlenecks
    - what details make the algorithm slow?
    - how can we improve that?
 - Unneccessary work
    - is there any unneccessary work to make the algo faster?
 - Duplicated work
    - same with the above

2. Space / Time trade-offs
 - Hashtable : good example of space/time trade-offs

3. DIY
 - Use your brain to find a shortcut algorithm
 - Try a large & generic example
