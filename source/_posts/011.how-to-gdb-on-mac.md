# How to gdb on Mac
Sadly, gdb is not built-in package for Mac. On Mac, the easiest way to install a package working mainly in CLI such as gdb, gcc, g++, and etc, is to use Brew (Homebrew).

``` bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

then, use the brew to install the gdb package.

``` bash
brew install gdb
```
> ➜  algorithms git:(master) ✗ brew install gdb
> Updating Homebrew...
> ==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/gdb-7.12_1.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz
> ######################################################################## 100.0%
> ==> Pouring gdb-7.12_1.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz
> ==> Caveats
> gdb requires special privileges to access Mach ports.
> You will need to codesign the binary. For instructions, see:

>   https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin

> On 10.12 (Sierra) or later with SIP, you need to run this:

>   echo "set startup-with-shell off" >> ~/.gdbinit
> ==> Summary
> 🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/7.12_1: 49 files, 6.8M

here goes the result!

```  
$ sudo gdb
```


> $ gdb

So simple!
 * Just remember that you should run gdb as the super user with "sudo" on mac.
